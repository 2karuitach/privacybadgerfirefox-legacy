    <p> This extension protects your privacy from third party trackers that load invisibly when you browse the web. We send the Do Not Track header, and our extension figures out if you are still being tracked. If so, we block your request from being send to the spying tracker. Our extension has three states. Red means block. Yellow means that we don't send cookies or referers. Blue means unblocked. You can toggle these by clicking the icon in the top right of a page. </p>
