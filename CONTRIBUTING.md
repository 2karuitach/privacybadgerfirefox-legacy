### Contributing

Before you submit a pull request:

0. In general, you should develop off of 'master' unless you are making a hotfix ('stable' is the current production-ready state).
1. Make sure your code conforms to the [Style Guide](doc/style.md).
2. Reference any issues that you are fixing in the commit message.
3. Make sure the tests pass. Please add tests for any new functionality.
4. BONUS: make sure your changes are compatible with the current Firefox ESR, Beta, and Aurora releases as well as the current stable release!
